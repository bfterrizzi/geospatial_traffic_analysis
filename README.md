geospatial analysis

Herein is a brief analysis project that I undertook to familiarize myself with the
Google cloud API and the the ggmap package in R. My primary goal was to learn how to 
plot data on top of geo-spatially defined maps obtained from the internet. None of the
conclusions in this brief report are to be taken seriously.
